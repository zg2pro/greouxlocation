to start an angular project:

-install nodejs, npm, yo, typescript, glup, express, all global

npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-typescript
yo typescript

(typescript comes with gulp)

-install the Netbeans plugin for Typescript and node
-in Netbeans options, point to the .cmd files inside the global node_modules, so that Netbeans targets can point to the gulp instructions to give in the gulp.js
-create a project from the "quickstart" of angular.io website (visit the plunker to download the files)
-create web/html5 project from existing sources in NetBeans
-use Netbeans to "resolve project problems", it will  propose to import all the missing npm modules

- for hosting purpose, can install either an easyPhp or a chrome netbeans extension that will host the website
